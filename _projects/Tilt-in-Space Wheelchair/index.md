title: Low-cost, Locally Manufacturable Tilt-in-Space Wheelchair
description: 
    Designed and validated a Tilt-in-Space wheelchair for use by Tanzanians with severe postural disabilities. This project was undertaken alongside five mechanical engineering undergraduate seniors, in two quarters (six months), with my role being the documentation focal point and validation lead! Our team worked with Kyaro Assistive Tech, a Tanzanian Non-Governmental Organization based in Arusha, Tanzania, making user-specific assistive devices accessible for East Africans. Our final wheelchair design has a final BOM cost of $50, which is drastically under our cost specification of $70 set by Kyaro Assistive Tech. Furthermore, our design exceeded all user and engineering requirements, making this wheelchair highly leveragable in the rugged Tanzanian environment. This wheelchair is inclusive of the potential use cases of 3.4 million East Africans with mobility disabilities. Our design was received highly by Stanford's Mechanical Engineering department and was subsequently published in the academic library (please feel free to check it out)!

# Header 1 
Used for the title (already generated automatically at the top)
## Header 2  
Use this for the header of each section
### Header 3 
Use this to have subsection if needed


## Embedding images 
### External images
{% include image-gallery.html images="https://flic.kr/p/2rceJqK" height="400"%}
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Picture of Tilt-in-Space Wheelchair Proof of Concept" from https://flic.kr/p/2rceJqK/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

## Starting a new line
leave two spaces "  " at the end or enter <br>

## Adding bold text
this is how you input **bold text**

## Adding italic text
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Adding ordered list
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header
